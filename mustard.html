                      3.	Prepare the soil by loosening it with a garden fork or tiller to a depth of at least 15 cm, removing any rocks, weeds, or other debris.<br>
                      4.	Sow the mustard seeds at a depth of about 1 cm, spacing them about 2.5 cm apart.<br>
                      5.	Water the soil gently but thoroughly, taking care not to wash away the seeds.<br>
                      6.	Cover the seeds with a layer of mulch or compost to help retain moisture in the soil.<br>

                      3.Monitor the seeds for signs of germination. You may start to see the seedlings emerging from the soil within a few days.<br>
                      
                      4.Once the seedlings emerge, provide them with at least 6 hours of sunlight per day.<br>

                      2. Provide the seedlings with at least 6 hours of sunlight per day. If the weather is cloudy, consider using grow lights to supplement natural light. <br>
                      3. Thin the seedlings to about 10 cm apart once they have developed their first true leaves. This will allow them to have enough space to grow properly. <br>
                      4. Apply a balanced fertilizer according to package instructions to provide the seedlings with essential nutrients for growth. <br>

                      2. Watch for signs of nutrient deficiency, such as yellowing or stunted growth, and adjust the fertilization schedule as needed. <br>
                      3. Ensure that the seedlings are receiving adequate sunlight, as insufficient light can cause them to become leggy and weak. <br>
                      4. Control any weeds that may be competing with the mustard seedlings for water and nutrients. Hand-pulling or hoeing are effective ways to remove weeds. <br>
                      5. Monitor the seedlings for pests such as aphids or flea beetles, which can damage the leaves. <br>
                      6. Use organic pest control methods, such as spraying with neem oil or using insecticidal soap, if necessary.<br>
                      
                      7.Remember to keep a close eye on the mustard seedlings during this stage of growth, as they are still vulnerable to environmental stresses and pest damage. By providing them with adequate water, nutrients, and sunlight, and protecting them from pests and weeds, you can help ensure their healthy development.<br>

                      2. Ensure that the plants are receiving at least 6 hours of sunlight per day. <br>
                      3. Watch for signs of bolting, which occurs when the mustard plants begin to produce flower stalks. If bolting occurs, harvest the leaves promptly to prevent them from becoming too bitter. <br>
                      4. Monitor the plants for disease, such as fungal leaf spots, and remove any affected leaves promptly to prevent the disease from spreading. <br>
                      5. Mulch around the base of the plants to help conserve moisture in the soil and suppress weed growth.<br>
                      
                      &nbsp; Remember that mustard plants grow quickly during this stage, and it's important to stay vigilant in monitoring their growth and health. By providing them with adequate water, nutrients, and sunlight, and controlling pests and diseases, you can help ensure a bountiful harvest.<br>
